#  Auction House Owner Pleads Guilty To Selling Fake Baccarat

The owner of an auction house in Pennsylvania has plead guilty to selling fake baccarat games. Officials say the owner and his employees created and sold more than 20,000 fake baccarat games worth over $1 million.

The scheme began to unravel after an undercover agent purchased a game from the auction house and later determined that it was fake. The agent then worked with officials to set up a sting operation and catch the owner selling additional games.

In total, the owner has plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud as well as money laundering. He faces up to 40 years in prison and a $5 million fine. His employees have also been charged in connection with the scheme.

#  $1.5M Baccarat Fraud Ring Allegedly Led By Taiwanese Businessman

In what could be the largest baccarat fraud ring in recent history, a Taiwanese businessman has been charged with leading a $1.5 million scam at three of Las Vegas’ most prestigious casinos. Prosecutors allege that the businessman and his associates would place high-value bets at the baccarat tables, only to deliberately lose the money by making incorrect plays.

The scheme was apparently so successful that the group managed to walk away with more than $600,000 in winnings over a two-month period. However, their luck finally ran out earlier this month when casino security staff became suspicious of their behavior and alerted the police.

Following a lengthy investigation, authorities have now arrested five people connected to the scheme, including the Taiwanese businessman and his two associates. All five are facing felony charges for racketeering, conspiracy to commit theft, and theft from an Indian gaming establishment.

This is not the first time that casinos have been targeted by baccarat fraudsters. In fact, just last year two men were sentenced to prison for running a similar scam worth $1 million. With so much money on the line, it’s no surprise that casino security staff are on high alert for any signs of cheating.

So far it’s unclear how the Taiwanese businessman and his associates managed to get away with their scam for so long. It’s possible that they were simply lucky in their bets, but it’s also possible that they were using some form of cheating technique such as card counting or edge sorting.

Whatever the case may be, this latest baccarat fraud ring is sure to raise concerns among casino operators worldwide. With so much money at stake, it’s important for casinos to be on the lookout for any signs of cheating and take steps to protect themselves against these types of scams.

#  Gambler Arrested For Trying To Cheat Casino Out Of $180K In Baccarat 

John M. was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly trying to cheat a casino out of $180,000 in baccarat.

The 52-year-old gambler from New Jersey was caught by casino staff using an electrical device known as a “monkey paw” to manipulate the game in his favor.

The device is made up of three metal prongs that are used to shuffle the cards and has been used in the past by other gamblers to cheat casinos out of money.

John M. has been charged with conspiracy to commit theft by deception and criminal mischief and was released after posting bail.

#  Casino Employee Facing Felony Charges Over $8,000 Baccarat Scam

In a case that has rocked the casino world, an employee of the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas is facing felony charges after allegedly scamming the casino out of more than $8,000 playing baccarat.

According to investigators, the employee used a series of elaborate betting strategies to win the money over a period of several months. The employee has since been fired by the casino, and could face up to five years in prison if convicted.

Casino officials are still investigating how the employee was able to get away with the scam for so long, and say they are working with law enforcement to try and recover the stolen funds. In the meantime, they are reminding all employees that any form of cheating is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.

This isn't the first time a casino employee has been caught cheating; in fact, it's becoming increasingly common as casinos become more high-tech and security measures become more sophisticated. So what can casinos do to prevent these kinds of scams?

One option is to increase security measures, including surveillance cameras and facial recognition software. However, this can be expensive and can't always prevent employees from cheating. Another option is to educate employees on what constitutes cheating and what the consequences will be if they are caught. This can help deter employees from trying to scam the casino, and also helps identify any potential scams before they have a chance to take root.

Ultimately, it's up to casinos themselves to take steps to protect their players and assets from being scammed. Employees who cheat need to be held accountable for their actions, and casinos should do everything they can to ensure that their players are treated fairly.
