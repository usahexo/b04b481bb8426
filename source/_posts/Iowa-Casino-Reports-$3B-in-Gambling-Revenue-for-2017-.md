#  Iowa Casino Reports $3B in Gambling Revenue for 2017 

The state of Iowa casinos has just released its 2017 gambling revenue report, and the totals are staggering. With combined revenues of over $3B, the state’s casinos have had their best year on record.

This news will no doubt be welcomed by the state’s lawmakers, who have long considered casinos a key element in Iowa’s tourism strategy. And with good reason – casino taxes account for an estimated one-third of all state property tax revenue.

So what is behind this sudden uptick in gambling revenue? There could be any number of factors at play, but one thing is for sure: casino operators are doing everything they can to attract players. This includes offering ever-more lucrative rewards programs, as well as expanding their gaming offerings to include new and innovative games.

It will be interesting to see if Iowa can maintain this level of success in the coming years. With online gambling continuing to grow in popularity, it will be increasingly difficult for the state’s casinos to maintain their edge. But for now, things are looking good and it looks like Iowa will continue to be a major player in the world of gambling.

#  Online Gambling Continues to Grow in Iowa 

In the early days of Iowa, gambling was outlawed. However, this has not stopped Iowans from enjoying games of chance. In fact, over the years, gambling has continued to grow in popularity in the state. There are now a number of venues where people can gamble, including casinos, racetracks, and bingo halls. And with the advent of online gambling, Iowans can now also enjoy gambling from the comfort of their own homes.

# The Growth of Casino Gambling in Iowa 

Casino gambling began to grow in popularity in Iowa in the 1990s. In 1995, there were only two casinos in the state—the Riverside Casino & Golf Resort and Casinos Rock Island. However, by 2006, that number had grown to nine. And today, there are fifteen casinos operating in Iowa.

Casinos offer a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, poker, and roulette. They also offer a variety of promotions and bonuses, which is one reason they have become so popular. In addition to being able to gamble on-site at casinos, Iowans can also gamble online. This has allowed even more people to get in on the action.

# The Growth of Racetrack Gambling in Iowa 

Racetrack gambling has been around for much longer than casino gambling in Iowa. The first racetrack opened in Davenport back in 1875. Today there are six racetracks operating in the state. Like casinos, racetracks offer a variety of games, including slots and table games like blackjack and roulette. They also offer betting on horse races and other sporting events.

Racetrack gambling is particularly popular among Iowans who like to gamble on sports events. In fact, over 60% of all betting that takes place at Iowa racetracks is done on sporting events. This is likely due to the fact that Iowans have access to some of the best odds on sports bets when they go to a racetrack compared to other states.

# The Growth of Bingo Hall Gambling in Iowa 

Bingo hall gambling is another form of gambling that has seen steady growth in Iowa over the years. The first bingo hall opened up in Des Moines back in 1978 and today there are sixty-six bingo halls operating throughout the state. Like other forms of gambling, bingo halls offer a variety of games, including slots and table games like blackjack and roulette. They also offer bingo games as well as other types of raffles and drawings.

Bingo hall gambling is particularly popular among seniors citizens who enjoy playing bingo as well as socializing with friends at bingo halls around the state. In fact, nearly 50% of all revenue generated by bingo halls in Iowa comes from players over the age of sixty-five

#  State Regulators Approve 2017 Gambling Report 

The State of Nevada Gambling Control Board has released its 2017 gambling report, which has been approved by state regulators. The report shows that the gambling industry in Nevada continues to grow, with total revenue up 3.5% year-over-year to $11.9 billion.

Casino gaming revenue was up 2.5% to $10.8 billion, while race and sports wagering was up 19% to $1.1 billion. Contributing to the growth in sports wagering was the expanded betting menu offered by Nevada casinos, which includes options such as in-game wagering and bets on fantasy sports contests.

The Nevada Gaming Commission also reported that casino gaming profits were up 5.5% to $1.9 billion in 2017, and that the state’s 60 operating casinos paid out a total of $291 million in taxes and fees. This represents an increase of 7% over 2016 levels.

In a statement, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said that the “growth in our gaming industry is a testament to the strength of our regulatory framework and the world-class resort destinations we have here in Nevada”. He added that the state is committed to ensuring that its gambling industry remains “the gold standard for gaming regulation”.

#  Iowa Gaming Association Releases Annual Report 

The Iowa Gaming Association has released its annual report for the fiscal year of 2017. The report, which is now available on the IGA website, provides an overview of the gaming industry in Iowa and its players, including casinos, racinos, and tribal gaming operations.

Some of the key findings from the report include:

#  Casino Industry Generates Nearly $3 Billion in Revenue

Casinos are a billion-dollar industry that continues to grow. In 2017, casino operators across the globe generated nearly $3 billion in revenue. In 2018, this number is expected to grow as new casinos open in different parts of the world.

The main drivers of this growth are Asia and the United States. In Asia, casino gambling is growing in popularity, and new casinos are being built at a rapid pace. Macau, in particular, is seeing explosive growth as more and more people come to gamble in its casinos. The United States is also seeing strong growth due to increasing interest in legal sports betting.

Despite concerns about the impact of online gambling, the casino industry continues to grow at a healthy rate. This is due to the fact that people enjoy gambling in physical casinos, and there is no sign of this trend changing anytime soon.
