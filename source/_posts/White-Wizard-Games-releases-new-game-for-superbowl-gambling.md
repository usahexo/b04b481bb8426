In the NFL, the two main ways to bet on the games are against the spread and over/under. When betting against the spread, you are betting that a team will lose by fewer points than what is predicted by the sportsbook. For example, if the Seahawks are playing the 49ers and the spread is -7.5 for Seattle, this means that Seattle is favored to win by 7.5 points. So if you bet on Seattle, they would have to win by 8 or more points for you to win your bet. If you bet on San Francisco, they could lose by up to 7 points and you would still win your bet. 

When betting over/under, you are betting on how many total points will be scored in the game. For example, if the over/under is set at 44.5, this means that you can bet on whether there will be more or less than 45 points scored in the game. If you bet over, then you are wagering that there will be more than 45 points scored and if you bet under, then you are stating that there will be less than 45 points scored. 

The following table displays each NFL team’s odds of making it to the playoffs, as well as their odds of winning Super Bowl 53: 

Team Playoff Odds Super Bowl Odds
New England Patriots 99% 2-1
Pittsburgh Steelers 95% 9-2
Minnesota Vikings 95% 11-2
Philadelphia Eagles 90% 6-1
Los Angeles Rams 85% 8-1
Green Bay Packers 80% 10-1
Houston Texans 70% 12-1
Atlanta Falcons 65% 16-1
Baltimore Ravens 60% 20-1
Jacksonville Jaguars 55% 25-1
Denver Broncos 50% 33-1
Tennessee Titans 40% 50-1 

As you can see, there is a lot of value in betting on some of these teams to make it to the Super Bowl. The Patriots have an excellent chance of making it to their ninth Super Bowl while teams like the Jaguars and Broncos have much lower odds but still provide some good value for those looking to make a longer shot bet.

As the Super Bowl rapidly approaches, many bettors are scrambling to learn the ins and outs of gambling on the big game. White Wizard Games is here to help with a free, comprehensive tutorial on how to gamble on the Super Bowl.

The first step is to decide what kind of wager you want to make. There are three basic types: straight bets, parlays, and teasers. A straight bet is simply betting on one team to win outright. A parlay is a bet on two or more teams where all teams must win for the wager to payout. A teaser is like a parlay, but with different point spreads for each team.

Once you've decided what type of wager you want to make, you need to choose your teams. Look at the odds for each team and find the best combination of odds and potential payout that suits your needs. Remember that it's usually not worth it to bet on a long shot; instead, try to find good combos of favorite teams and underdogs.

Now it's time to place your bet! Go to an online sportsbook or visit your local casino and put down your money on the outcome you predict will happen.

If your predictions are correct, you'll walk away with some nice payouts! But remember that even if you lose your initial wager, there's still plenty of action left in the game, so stay tuned and enjoy the best football matchup of the year!

#  Learn The Secret Of Super Bowl Gambling From White Wizard Games

The gambling world is all aflutter with the Super Bowl coming up. Whether you are a seasoned vet or novice, White Wizard Games has some advice to make sure your bets pay off.

There are many different ways to gamble on the Super Bowl. The options include picking the winner of the game, betting on points spread, betting on over/under touchdowns scored, and a few others. Let’s take a look at each one in detail.

Picking the Winner of the Game

This is the simplest bet of them all and also the most popular. Most sportsbooks will have odds for who will win the game. Simply pick which team you think will win and place your bet. If they win, you win!

Points Spread Betting

This type of bet takes into account how many points one team is favored to win by. For instance, if Team A is favored to beat Team B by 14 points, then someone betting on Team A would need them to win by more than 14 points in order to make money. If they only won by 13 points, then they would have lost money even though they technically won the game. Conversely, someone betting on Team B would profit if Team B beat Team A by more than 14 points.

Betting on Over/Under Touchdowns Scored

This type of wager simply bets on whether more or less than a certain number of touchdowns will be scored in the game. For example, if someone bets that there will be over 4 touchdowns scored in the game, then they would win if 5 or more touchdowns were scored. If fewer than 4 touchdowns were scored, then they would lose their bet.
