#  How to Switch on the Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight

Batman Arkham Knight introduces a number of new gameplay features to the series, including the Batmobile. One such feature is the ability to use the Batmobile as a slot machine. To switch on the slot machine, you need to complete a certain task in the game.

The first step is to find and activate four fuse boxes scattered around Gotham City. Once you have found all four, return to the Batcave and approach the large console in the center of the room. Activate it by pressing and holding down both triggers (L2 and R2). A on-screen prompt will then ask you to enter a code.

Use the following code: R2, L1, R1, L2, Up, Left, Down, Right. This will activate the slot machine. Batman Arkham Knight also includes a number of other secret codes that can be used to unlock various rewards.

#  How to use the Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight

The Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight is a fun diversion that can provide you with helpful rewards if you know how to use it correctly. The Slot Machine is located in the Billiards Room in the Clock Tower.

The basic premise of the Slot Machine is to match three symbols to win a prize. There are six different icons that can appear on the Slot Machine, and each one has a different payout. The payouts are as follows:

Symbol Payout

Heart 10 coins

Club 20 coins

Spade 30 coins

Diamond 50 coins

Money 100 coins

Batarang 500 coins
+1,000 for five Batarangs in a row!

  To use the Slot Machine, insert your desired amount of coins into the machine. Once you have inserted your coins, press the start button to begin spinning the reels. The reels will spin for a few seconds and then stop. If you have matched three symbols, you will win the corresponding payout. If you have not matched three symbols, your coins will be returned to you.   The best way to increase your chances of winning at the Slot Machine is to familiarize yourself with all of the different symbols and their payouts. This way, you will know which symbols to aim for when playing the game. Additionally, try to keep an eye on which symbols are being displayed on the machine before making your bet. This will give you some idea about what kind of payout you could potentially win if you match three symbols.

#  How to Unlock the Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight

There are different methods that can be used to unlock the slot machine in Batman Arkham Knight. The first is to purchase the DLC pack that includes the unlock code. The second is to find the three bandages in the game and then go to the Gotham Casino. The last is to use a cheat code.

The first method is to purchase the DLC pack that includes the unlock code. The DLC pack can be purchased for $4.99 on Steam or for $6.99 on PlayStation Network. Once the DLC has been purchased, the player needs to enter the code “Kryptonite” into the console command line in order to unlock it.

The second method is to find the three bandages in the game and then go to the Gotham Casino. The bandages can be found in different locations depending on which platform the game is being played on. The Xbox One version of the game has a bandage located in Ace Chemicals, one located underneath Solomon Wayne Courthouse, and one located at Founders Island. The PlayStation 4 version of the game has a bandage located at Panessa Studios, one located underneath LadyJustice statue in Gotham City Hall, and one located at Amusement Mile. The PC version of the game does not have any specific locations for finding bandages, but they will generally be located near major landmarks.

Once all three bandages have been found, they need to be taken to Harley Quinn’s office in Joker’s Funhouse. In order to get into Joker’s Funhouse, there are two methods that can be used: either ride Harley Quinn’s bike throughout Gotham City or use her special keycard that she drops after completing level 12 of AR Challenges. After taking all three bandages to Harley Quinn’s office, she will give players access to the Gotham Casino where they can use them to play on the slot machine.

The last method is to use a cheat code. A cheat code for unlocking casino content can be found below:
