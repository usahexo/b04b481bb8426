#  Percy Jackson Casino Scene Filmed In Kyrgyzstan!

After a long search for the perfect location, the much anticipated Percy Jackson casino scene was finally filmed in Kyrgyzstan. The stunning scenery of the Tien Shan Mountains provided a perfect backdrop for the all-important scene.

The cast and crew were very complimentary of Kyrgyzstan, praising its natural beauty and great facilities. Filming went smoothly and everyone had a terrific time.

The producers are already considering returning to film other scenes in Kyrgyzstan – it’s clear that this is a location with lots to offer the film industry!

#  Incredible! Percy Jackson & The Casino Scene Was Filmed In Kyrgyzstan!

Casinos and Percy Jackson fans alike were surprised to learn that the casino scene in the blockbuster movie was filmed at a casino in Kyrgyzstan. What may be more surprising is that the filmmakers went to great lengths to make sure the casino looked like it was right in Las Vegas.

The casino, which is located in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, had to be completely remodeled for the shoot. The crew added all of the features you would expect in a top-notch Las Vegas casino, including slot machines, gaming tables, and even a neon sign. They then filmed scenes with actors Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson) and Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth Chase) walking through the casino and playing poker.

It's not clear why the filmmakers decided to film in Kyrgyzstan instead of Nevada, but it's possible that they were able to save money on location costs. The casino scene ended up being one of the most expensive scenes in the movie, costing around $1 million to produce.

Despite the high price tag, the scene turned out great and helped make the movie a box office success. The casino in Bishkek has seen a surge in tourism since the movie came out, with people coming from all over to take pictures and try their luck at gambling.
