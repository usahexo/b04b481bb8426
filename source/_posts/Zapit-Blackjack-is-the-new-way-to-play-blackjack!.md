#  How does Zapit Blackjack work?

Zapit Blackjack is an online casino game that allows players to make stakes and bet on the outcome of their hands. The game is played between the player and the dealer, with each player being dealt two cards. The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21.

If the player’s first two cards total 21, they have a blackjack and automatically win. If the player’s first two cards are equal to the dealer’s first two cards, it is called a “push” and no money changes hands. In all other cases, the player must decide whether to “hit” (take another card), “stand” (end their turn), or “double down” (increase their bet and receive just one more card).

If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose their bet even if the dealer also busts. If the dealer has a blackjack, all players who are not also holding blackjacks lose regardless of what their hand totals are.

# How do I play Zapit Blackjack?

To play Zapit Blackjack, visit an online casino that offers this version of the game. Most casinos allow players to try out games for free before making any real money bets, so be sure to take advantage of this feature if you are new to Zapit Blackjack or any other casino game.

Once you have registered for an account and deposited funds into your casino account, choose Zapit Blackjack from the list of games and click on it to open up a table. You will then be able to see how many seats are available at each table as well as what minimum and maximum bets are allowed. Choose a table that fits your bankroll and click on it to open up a seat.

You will be dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer will have one face-up and one face-down. It is important to remember that the aim of the game is not simply to beat the dealer’s hand total; you must also stay under 21 yourself. So if you are dealt an Ace and a 6 (), for example, your best move would be to stand as your total of 17 falls within expected values given current rules and conditions at most tables.
