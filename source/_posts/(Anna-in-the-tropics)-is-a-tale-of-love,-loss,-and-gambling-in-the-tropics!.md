#  (Anna in the tropics) is a tale of love, loss, and gambling in the tropics!

After the death of his father, young * (Robert) is sent to live with his uncle in the Caribbean. There, he meets the beautiful * (Anna), and the two fall in love. However, Robert's uncle is a gambling addict, and soon Robert is caught up in the high-stakes world of casino gambling.

As Robert and Anna's love grows stronger, so does their desire to win at the casino. But eventually, the inevitable happens: they lose everything. Their dream home, their cars, even their furniture. Reduced to nothing but rags, they are forced to leave the island and start over again.

But even this setback does not stop them from trying to win back what they lost. And finally, after many years of hard work and sacrifice, they succeed. They return to the tropics - a place that will always hold a special place in their hearts - and they finally find happiness once again.

It is not only a way to make money, but also a form of recreation. Gambling is introduced early in the play, when Anna’s father tells her about a man who made a fortune in the stock market. Anna is immediately intrigued and asks her father to teach her how to gamble.

 subsequent gambling scenes reinforce the idea that gambling can be both entertaining and profitable. For example, in one scene, Anna wins a large amount of money playing poker, while in another scene, she loses all her savings playing the same game.

Despite the risks involved, Anna continues to gamble throughout the play. This may be because she is attracted to the excitement and thrill of winning – or losing – money. It could also be because she wants to prove that she can be as successful as her father.
