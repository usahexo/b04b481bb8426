#  How to win Tarzan position machine game - Graham Greene 

The Tarzan position machine game is a three-reel, five-payline slot game that has a wild symbol and a bonus round. The object of the game is to achieve a winning combination by spinning the reels.

To play the game, first select your coin value by clicking on the + or - buttons next to COIN VALUE. Next, choose how many lines you want to play by clicking on the + or - buttons next to LINES. Finally, click on SPIN REELS to start playing.

The Tarzan position machine game has two special symbols: the wild symbol and the bonus symbol. The wild symbol substitutes for any other symbol to form a winning combination. The bonus symbol triggers the bonus round when it appears on the first and third reels at the same time.

In the bonus round, you must help Tarzan swing across the vines to capture as many fruit as possible. You are awarded a prize for every fruit you capture. The bonus round ends when you either miss a vine or catch a snake.

Tarzan position machine game is a new game by Graham Greene. It is a 3D physics based game where you swing through the jungle as Tarzan. It is currently in beta for Android devices, and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

The aim of the game is to swing through the jungle and collect coins. There are also various obstacles in your way, which you need to avoid. The sooner you finish the level, the more points you score.

The controls are very simple - just swipe left and right to move Tarzan around, and tap anywhere on the screen to swing. You can also use two fingers to swing faster.

The graphics are very good, and it's great fun swinging through the jungle. There are also power-ups available which can help you get further in the game.

#  Graham Greene's guide to winning Tarzan position machine game 

There is a machine in the zoo that you can use to try to win the position of Tarzan. I have won the game many times, and I am going to share my strategy with you.

The key to winning is to hit the lever as fast as possible. You want to hit it as soon as the image of Tarzan appears. If you wait too long, he will disappear and you will lose your chance.

Another thing to keep in mind is how far away Tarzan is from you when you hit the lever. If he is too close, you will not be able to reach him and you will lose. So make sure he is far enough away that you can hit him with your punch.

The last thing to keep in mind is which way Tarzan is facing. He sometimes faces left, and sometimes faces right. You want to make sure you are hitting the lever in the same direction that he is facing, so that you can reach him with your punch.

Good luck! I hope you can win the position of Tarzan using these tips.
