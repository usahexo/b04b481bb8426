#  Why Eliot?

Boston is a city of neighborhoods. Each with their own unique style and flavor. From the North End’s Italian district to West Roxbury’s Irish enclave, each neighborhood has its own culture and appeal. One such neighborhood is the South End.

Originally a manufacturing district, the South End has seen tremendous redevelopment over the past few decades. The brick warehouses and factories have been replaced with high-rise apartments and trendy restaurants. And while this new development has brought new life to the neighborhood, it has also caused rents to skyrocket, making it difficult for many longtime residents to afford to stay.

This is where Eliot comes in.

Eliot is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2006 with the goal of helping low- and moderate-income families stay in the South End. Eliot offers a variety of programs and services, including affordable housing, financial assistance, and social services.

One of Eliot’s most popular programs is its affordable housing initiative. Eliot owns and manages more than 800 units of affordable housing in the South End, including townhouses, apartments, and dormitories. These units are open to residents who earn 60% or less of Boston’s Area Median Income (AMI).

In addition to its affordable housing initiatives, Eliot also provides financial assistance to help residents pay their rent or utility bills. Eliot offers two types of financial assistance: emergency assistance and monthly assistance. Emergency assistance can provide up to $600 in one-time financial assistance, while monthly assistance can provide up to $500 in recurring financial assistance.

Eliot also provides social services to help residents connect with important community resources. Services include case management, youth programming, food pantries, and more.
