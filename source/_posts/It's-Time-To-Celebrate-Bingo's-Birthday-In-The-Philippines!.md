#  It's Time To Celebrate Bingo's Birthday In The Philippines!

On July 26, we celebrate the birthday of one of the most popular games in the Philippines- bingo! This noisy and exciting pastime has a long history that can be traced back to 1530AD when an Italian monk named Girolamo Cardano invented a game called Lo Giuoco del Lotto D'Italia.

Fast forward to the late 1800s and a London tavern owner named Edwin S. Lowe reinvented the game and called it "bingo". He is credited with inventing the numbered balls and also the idea of calling out numbers randomly. The popularity of bingo soon spread to America, and by the 1930s, there were bingo parlors all over the country.

The Philippines picked up bingo in the 1970s and it has since become one of our favorite pastimes. There are now countless bingo parlors all over the country, and every day thousands of people flock to these establishments to try their luck at winning some cash prizes.

So why is bingo so popular in the Philippines? There are probably a few reasons. For starters, it's a fun game that's easy tolearn- even kids can play it. It's also a social game that people can play together, which is perfect for get-togethers or parties. And finally, it's a game that offers players the chance to win real money prizes, which is always attractive to gamblers.

So if you're looking for something fun to do on July 26th, why not head down to your nearest bingo parlor and join in on the birthday celebration? You might just end up winning some cash prizes!

#  Bingo Turns A Year Older In The Philippines This Month!

March is the month where everyone in the Philippines celebrates the birth of one of the most popular pasalubongs or gifts that we can give to our loved ones - BINGO!

This somewhat traditional game has turned a year older in the Philippines this month and we couldn't be any more thrilled to have it around. If you're not familiar with bingo, it's basically a grid-like game board with 5 columns and 5 rows that have randomly generated numbers assigned to them.

The game starts by having players mark off numbers on their boards as the caller calls out random balls drawn from a bingo machine. The first player to fill up a row, column, or diagonal line on their board wins the game.

There are different variations of bingo but the most common one is called " blackout". In this version, players need to mark off all numbers on their boards in order to win. This type of game usually lasts for about 5-10 rounds and is especially popular during holidays and special occasions.

So why do we love bingo so much? For starters, it's a relatively easy game to learn and play. It doesn't require any strategic thinking or complex moves - all you need is some luck and quick reflexes. Secondly, it's a great way to bond with friends and family. There's nothing quite like screaming BINGO at the top of your lungs when you finally hit that winning combination. Lastly, it's just plain FUN! Who wouldn't love spending an evening playing some good old fashioned bingo?
