#  Bond Implicated in Massive Casino Heist 

The police have announced that international bond and investment guru, Phillip Greening, has been implicated in the theft of $2.3 million from the casino at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

The theft, which took place on the night of October 2, was carried out by a team of masked gunmen who burst into the casino's cash room and made off with several bags of money. Security footage shows one of the gunmen wearing what appears to be a disguise similar to that worn by Greening in a recently-released commercial for his new bond fund.

When questioned by police, Greening denied any involvement in the robbery, but could not offer an explanation as to why his disguise would have been worn by one of the robbers. He is currently being held on suspicion of criminal conspiracy and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

This is not the first time that Greening has been involved in a high-profile crime. In 2009, he was arrested and charged with insider trading after authorities discovered that he had made millions of dollars betting against two pharmaceutical companies whose stocks he knew were about to plummet. He was eventually acquitted of all charges, but this latest incident is sure to damage his reputation still further.

#  Bond Steals Millions from Casino Suprême 

It was a beautiful day in Monaco as the sun shined and the birds chirped. The waves of the Mediterranean Sea glittered in the light as they crashed against the shore. James Bond, Agent 007, walked through the casino doors and headed to his usual spot at the blackjack table. 

After a few hands, Bond had accumulated quite a bit of chips. He decided to take a break from the table and went to get something to drink. As he turned to leave, he noticed a familiar face at the roulette table - Mr. White, one of his deadliest enemies. 

Bond knew that it was only a matter of time before Mr. White made his move, so he decided to keep an eye on him. Sure enough, after a few minutes, Mr. White placed a large bet on red. The wheel spun and landed on black - sending Mr. White into a fit of rage. 

Bond took this opportunity to make his move. He calmly walked up to Mr. White and said "That's two bullets for you, my friend." before shooting him dead.

#  Bond Turns out to be a Casino Thief 

Investors in the $11 billion James Bond franchise were dealt a stunning blow this week when it was revealed that the fictional British Secret Service agent has been stealing from casinos all over the world.

Bond is believed to have stolen millions of dollars from casinos in Macau, Las Vegas, and Monaco over the past decade, using his knowledge of security systems and disguises to carry out the heists undetected.

In a statement, MGM Studios, which produces the Bond movies, said that it was “saddened and disappointed” by the news, but that it would continue to support its embattled star.

The revelations about Bond’s casino thefts come as a major embarrassment to MGM and its parent company Sony, both of which are struggling with declining profits and mounting debts.

Several members of Congress have called for a congressional investigation into Bond’s activities, while casino owners around the world are threatening to sue MGM for damages.

The news comes as a major blow to the 007 franchise, which is one of the most successful in Hollywood history. The last Bond movie, Skyfall, earned more than $1.1 billion at the global box office.

#  Bond Accused of Playing Dealer in Casino Heist 

Nicknamed "the casino bandit," British actor Daniel Craig is accused of playing dealer in a casino heist. According to reports, the Ocean's Eleven star was caught on camera dealing cards at the blackjack table moments before £ Casino heist ensued.

The Crown Prosecution Service has announced that it will be pressing charges against the James Bond actor. A spokesperson for the service said, "We have compelling evidence that Mr. Craig was involved in this crime. He can expect to face prosecution."

Craig's lawyer released a statement denying the allegations and insisting that his client is innocent. "Mr. Craig was in fact not even in the country at the time of the robbery. We are confident that when the evidence is presented in court, Mr. Craig will be cleared of any wrongdoing."

The casino heist took place in May of last year and resulted in the theft of more than £200,000 from a London casino. Eight people have been charged in connection with the robbery, but so far no one has been convicted. If convicted, Craig could face up to 10 years imprisonment.

#  How Much Did Bond Hint the Dealer in Casino Suprême PlayOK.com?

If you are a fan of the James Bond movies, then you know that one of the key aspects of the films is the suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat action. This is nowhere more evident than in the scene where Bond is playing against the dealer in Casino Suprême PlayOK.com.

What you may not know, however, is just how much Bond hinted the dealer in this scene. The answer may surprise you.

In order to figure out how much Bond hinted the dealer, we need to look at two things: the odds of each possible hand and the bet Bond placed.

For simplicity’s sake, let’s assume that there are only four hands possible: a pair, two pair, three of a kind, or a straight. Given these odds, if Bond had simply guessed which hand he was facing, his odds of winning would be 1 in 4 (25%).

However, by hinting at which hand he was holding, Bond gave himself a better chance of winning. In fact, his odds increased to 3 in 4 (75%)!

So how much did Bond actually win by hinting? If we assume that the average value of each hand is $100, then Bond won an extra $200 by hinting at his hand. Not bad for an edge-of-your-seat scene!
