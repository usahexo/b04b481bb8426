#  How to Play Blackout Bingo for Fun and Profit

Playing blackout bingo can be a fun and profitable way to spend your time. This game is played by marking off numbers on a bingo card as they are called. The first player to mark off all of their numbers wins the game.

There are a few different ways to play blackout bingo. One common way is to use a regular deck of playing cards. Each player is dealt five cards, and the remainder of the deck is placed face down in the middle of the players. The top card is turned over and placed next to the deck to start the turn. Play then proceeds clockwise, with each player either playing one of their cards or picking up another card from the deck. When a player plays a card, they place it face up in front of them. Cards that are not played are saved for later turns. The winner is the first player to play all of their cards.

Another way to play blackout bingo is with a set of numbered tiles. In this version, each player starts with 25 tiles. The tiles are numbered 1-25, and each player has five of each number. Play begins by drawing five tiles from the bag and placing them in a row in front of the player, face up. The player then takes one tile at a time from the bag and discards it into another bag or box on their side of the playing area. If during their turn they draw a number that they already have in front of them, they must replace that tile with another from the bag and continue playing. The first player to discard all 25 tiles wins the game.
