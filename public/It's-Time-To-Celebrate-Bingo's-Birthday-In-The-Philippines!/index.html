This noisy and exciting pastime has a long history that can be traced back to 1530AD when an Italian monk named Girolamo Cardano invented a game called Lo Giuoco del Lotto D’Italia.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the late 1800s and a London tavern owner named Edwin S. Lowe reinvented the game and called it “bingo”. He is credited with inventing the numbered balls and also the idea of calling out numbers randomly. The popularity of bingo soon spread to America, and by the 1930s, there were bingo parlors all over the country.</p>
<p>The Philippines picked up bingo in the 1970s and it has since become one of our favorite pastimes. There are now countless bingo parlors all over the country, and every day thousands of people flock to these establishments to try their luck at winning some cash prizes.</p>
<p>So why is bingo so popular in the Philippines? There are probably a few reasons. For starters, it’s a fun game that’s easy tolearn- even kids can play it. It’s also a social game that people can play together, which is perfect for get-togethers or parties. And finally, it’s a game that offers players the chance to win real money prizes, which is always attractive to gamblers.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for something fun to do on July 26th, why not head down to your nearest bingo parlor and join in on the birthday celebration? You might just end up winning some cash prizes!</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-Turns-A-Year-Older-In-The-Philippines-This-Month"><a href="#Bingo-Turns-A-Year-Older-In-The-Philippines-This-Month" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Turns A Year Older In The Philippines This Month!"></a>Bingo Turns A Year Older In The Philippines This Month!</h1><p>March is the month where everyone in the Philippines celebrates the birth of one of the most popular pasalubongs or gifts that we can give to our loved ones - BINGO!</p>
<p>This somewhat traditional game has turned a year older in the Philippines this month and we couldn’t be any more thrilled to have it around. If you’re not familiar with bingo, it’s basically a grid-like game board with 5 columns and 5 rows that have randomly generated numbers assigned to them.</p>
<p>The game starts by having players mark off numbers on their boards as the caller calls out random balls drawn from a bingo machine. The first player to fill up a row, column, or diagonal line on their board wins the game.</p>
<p>There are different variations of bingo but the most common one is called “ blackout”. In this version, players need to mark off all numbers on their boards in order to win. This type of game usually lasts for about 5-10 rounds and is especially popular during holidays and special occasions.</p>
<p>So why do we love bingo so much? For starters, it’s a relatively easy game to learn and play. It doesn’t require any strategic thinking or complex moves - all you need is some luck and quick reflexes. Secondly, it’s a great way to bond with friends and family. There’s nothing quite like screaming BINGO at the top of your lungs when you finally hit that winning combination. Lastly, it’s just plain FUN! Who wouldn’t love spending an evening playing some good old fashioned bingo?</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-Turns-One-In-The-Philippines-This-Month"><a href="#Bingo-Turns-One-In-The-Philippines-This-Month" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Turns One In The Philippines This Month!"></a>Bingo Turns One In The Philippines This Month!</h1><p>After a very successful first year, Bingo is set to celebrate its first anniversary in the Philippines this month!</p>
<p>What started as an online game enjoyed by many has turned into a physical activity enjoyed by even more Filipinos. Just last year alone, an estimated 10 million people played Bingo in the country. And with the upcoming anniversary celebration, that number is only expected to grow!</p>
<p>Major sponsors and partners of the event include SM Supermalls, PLDT Home Fibr, Coca-Cola, Palawan Pawnshop and Metrobank. Together, they are gearing up for a month-long celebration filled with exciting activities and promos for all Bingo players.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight of the celebration is the much-awaited National Finals Competition on September 22 at the Mall of Asia Arena. The competition will crown the best Bingo player in the country and award him or her with a grand prize worth PHP 1 million.</p>
<p>“We at SM are excited to support another fun and well-loved Philippine tradition – playing Bingo! This month-long celebration offers something for everyone – from new and experienced players alike. We hope that through this event, we can bring more families and friends together in a truly enjoyable way,” said Jonjon San Agustin, Head of Marketing for SM Supermalls.</p>

<p>Bingo, which is said to have originated in Italy, was introduced in the Philippines in the 1930s. It became popular during World War II as a way for soldiers to pass the time. The game eventually caught on with the general public and has been a favorite ever since.</p>
<p>To celebrate bingo’s birthday, various events are being held throughout the month. In Manila, for example, the Shangri-La Plaza Mall is hosting a “Bingo Wonderland” from March 10-26. Players can enjoy special discounts on food and drinks at participating restaurants, as well as free games and other prizes.</p>
<p>In addition, several online casinos are offering special bonuses and promotions for players who want to celebrate bingo’s birthday online. 888ladies is giving away £888 worth of bonus money to all players who make a minimum deposit of £10, while tombola is offering players up to £50 in bonus money depending on their deposit amount.</p>
<p>Overall, March promises to be a fun month for bingo fans in the Philippines!</p>
