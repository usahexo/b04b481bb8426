            <h1 id="New-gambling-licensing-framework-to-be-rolled-out-in-Luxembourg"><a href="#New-gambling-licensing-framework-to-be-rolled-out-in-Luxembourg" class="headerlink" title="New gambling licensing framework to be rolled out in Luxembourg"></a>New gambling licensing framework to be rolled out in Luxembourg</h1><p>The government of Luxembourg is to implement a new licensing framework for gambling operators in the country. The new framework will be rolled out in stages, with the first phase scheduled to take effect on 1 January 2019.</p>
<p>The aim of the new framework is to improve the governance of the gambling sector in Luxembourg and to ensure that operators are held to high standards of integrity and consumer protection. The framework will also seek to boost tax revenue from gambling activities.</p>
<p>Under the new regime, all gambling operators will be required to hold a licence from the government. Licences will be issued on a range of different criteria, including the nature of the gambling activity, the location of the operator, and whether or not they are licensed in another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Licensed operators will be subject to a number of regulatory requirements, including contributing to responsible gambling initiatives and protecting minors from being exposed to gambling. They will also be required to provide accurate information about their services to consumers.</p>
<p>The government has said that it intends to work closely with industry stakeholders as the new framework is developed and implemented. This includes meeting with representatives from the betting, casino, and online gaming sectors to discuss how best to regulate their activities.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is not alone in implementing a more stringent licensing regime for gambling operators. In recent years, a number of other European countries have introduced similar frameworks, including Sweden, Italy, and Denmark.</p>
<h1 id="The-state-lottery-is-to-be-privatised"><a href="#The-state-lottery-is-to-be-privatised" class="headerlink" title="The state lottery is to be privatised"></a>The state lottery is to be privatised</h1><p>The Queensland state government has announced its intention to privatise the state lottery. This follows on from a similar decision made by the New South Wales government in November last year.</p>
<p>Critics of the move argue that it will lead to higher prices and reduced services for lottery players. They also claim that it is simply a way for the government to raise money without having to raise taxes.</p>
<p> Supporters of the move argue that it will lead to more innovation and better services for lottery players. They also claim that it will lead to more investment in the lottery industry, creating jobs and economic growth.</p>
<p>The truth is that nobody knows for sure what the impact of privatisation will be. Only time will tell whether it is good or bad for the Queensland state lottery.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-advertising-set-to-be-liberalised"><a href="#Gambling-advertising-set-to-be-liberalised" class="headerlink" title="Gambling advertising set to be liberalised"></a>Gambling advertising set to be liberalised</h1><p>The UK government is set to liberalise gambling advertising, in a move that is likely to be welcomed by the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The change in policy will see restrictions on how gambling advertising can be displayed relaxed, with ministers arguing that it will bring the UK into line with other countries.</p>
<p>Critics of the move have warned that it could lead to an increase in problem gambling, but the government is confident that the new regulations will be effective in protecting people from harm.</p>
<p>“As we liberalise our gambling sector, we are committed to protecting people from harm,” said Culture Secretary Matt Hancock. “These new rules will give us the strongest protections in Europe and ensure our industry remains one of the safest in the world.”</p>
<p>The government first mooted plans to relax gambling advertising rules last year, but they were met with opposition from a number of campaign groups. However, following a review of the proposals, ministers have decided to push ahead with them.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, gambling firms will be allowed to advertise their products on TV during family-friendly programmes between 7am and 10pm. They will also be able to sponsor sporting events and use celebrities to promote their brands.</p>
<p>In addition, adverts for online casinos and bingo sites will be allowed on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, provided they are targeted at adults aged 18 or over.</p>
<h1 id="Remote-gambling-to-be-legalised"><a href="#Remote-gambling-to-be-legalised" class="headerlink" title="Remote gambling to be legalised"></a>Remote gambling to be legalised</h1><p><strong>The NSW state government is looking to legalise remote gambling in the state, as announced in the state budget this week. This would enable gamblers to place bets online or over the phone, with bookmakers based outside of Australia.</strong></p>
<p>It’s been reported that this move could bring in $130 million in revenue for the state government each year, as well as create up to 1000 jobs. The legislation is set to be introduced in parliament later this year.</p>
<p> Premier Gladys Berejiklian defended the move, saying that it would provide more choice and convenience for consumers, and that the government would put in place strict regulations to ensure that all gambling was fair and safe.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Luke Foley criticised the move, saying that it would lead to more problem gambling and expose people to online scams. However, Berejiklian argued that these risks were already present with illegal offshore betting, and that the new laws would actually help to better regulate the industry.</p>
<p>Remote gambling has been legal in Victoria since 2012, and there have been no major problems reported there. In fact, research suggests that most people who gamble online do so without any negative consequences.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no response from the federal government on whether they will also introduce similar laws.</p>
<h1 id="Land-based-casinos-to-open-in-Luxembourg"><a href="#Land-based-casinos-to-open-in-Luxembourg" class="headerlink" title="Land-based casinos to open in Luxembourg"></a>Land-based casinos to open in Luxembourg</h1><p>Luxembourg is a small country in Western Europe, bordering France, Belgium and Germany. The country has been ruled by a grand duke since 1815, and is now home to over 600,000 people.</p>
<p>The gambling industry in Luxembourg is currently worth an estimated €1.5 billion, and the government has now announced plans to open five new land-based casinos in the country. The plan is part of a wider strategy to boost tourism in Luxembourg, and the new casinos are expected to create around 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The casinos will be operated by private companies, but the government will retain a 50% stake in each casino. Interested parties can submit proposals until the end of March, and the first casinos are expected to open their doors in 2020.</p>
<p>Gambling has been legal in Luxembourg since 1843, and the country currently has four licensed land-based casinos. Online gambling is also legal in Luxembourg, and there are around 30 operators offering their services to residents of the country.</p>
