The stunning scenery of the Tien Shan Mountains provided a perfect backdrop for the all-important scene.</p>
<p>The cast and crew were very complimentary of Kyrgyzstan, praising its natural beauty and great facilities. Filming went smoothly and everyone had a terrific time.</p>
<p>The producers are already considering returning to film other scenes in Kyrgyzstan – it’s clear that this is a location with lots to offer the film industry!</p>
<h1 id="Incredible-Percy-Jackson-amp-The-Casino-Scene-Was-Filmed-In-Kyrgyzstan"><a href="#Incredible-Percy-Jackson-amp-The-Casino-Scene-Was-Filmed-In-Kyrgyzstan" class="headerlink" title="Incredible! Percy Jackson &amp; The Casino Scene Was Filmed In Kyrgyzstan!"></a>Incredible! Percy Jackson &amp; The Casino Scene Was Filmed In Kyrgyzstan!</h1><p>Casinos and Percy Jackson fans alike were surprised to learn that the casino scene in the blockbuster movie was filmed at a casino in Kyrgyzstan. What may be more surprising is that the filmmakers went to great lengths to make sure the casino looked like it was right in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The casino, which is located in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, had to be completely remodeled for the shoot. The crew added all of the features you would expect in a top-notch Las Vegas casino, including slot machines, gaming tables, and even a neon sign. They then filmed scenes with actors Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson) and Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth Chase) walking through the casino and playing poker.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why the filmmakers decided to film in Kyrgyzstan instead of Nevada, but it’s possible that they were able to save money on location costs. The casino scene ended up being one of the most expensive scenes in the movie, costing around $1 million to produce.</p>
<p>Despite the high price tag, the scene turned out great and helped make the movie a box office success. The casino in Bishkek has seen a surge in tourism since the movie came out, with people coming from all over to take pictures and try their luck at gambling.</p>

The Casino Scene In Percy Jackson Was Filmed In Kyrgyzstan"></a>Who Knew? The Casino Scene In Percy Jackson Was Filmed In Kyrgyzstan</h1><p>In an interview with the cast and crew of Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, we learned that the casino scene was filmed in Kyrgyzstan. This small country located in central Asia provided the perfect backdrop for the glitzy and glamorous casino.</p>
<p>Director Thor Freudenthal had this to say about shooting in Kyrgyzstan: “The casino set was amazing. It’s a very colorful and vibrant place, and we were able to find all sorts of interesting props and textures to use in the scene.”</p>
<p>Producer Karen Rosenfelt added: “Kyrgyzstan was great to work with. The people are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and they really went out of their way to help us with our shoot.”</p>
<p>The cast also had high praise for the location. Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson) said: “It was really fun filming in Kyrgyzstan. The scenery is beautiful, and it was great getting to work with such a talented team.”</p>
<p>Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth Chase) agreed, adding: “I loved filming in Kyrgyzstan. It’s such an interesting country, and the locals were so warm and welcoming.”</p>
<p>Despite its small size, Kyrgyzstan is a fascinating country with a rich culture and history. If you’re looking for an exotic travel destination, be sure to add Kyrgyzstan to your list!</p>
<h1 id="Percy-Jackson-Fans-Rejoice-The-Casino-Scene-Was-Filmed-In-Kyrgyzstan"><a href="#Percy-Jackson-Fans-Rejoice-The-Casino-Scene-Was-Filmed-In-Kyrgyzstan" class="headerlink" title="Percy Jackson Fans Rejoice! The Casino Scene Was Filmed In Kyrgyzstan"></a>Percy Jackson Fans Rejoice! The Casino Scene Was Filmed In Kyrgyzstan</h1><p>It’s been a little more than 10 years since the Percy Jackson book series was born, and for die-hard fans, the long wait for the much anticipated film adaptation is finally over. The good news doesn’t stop there though, it turns out that one of the most exciting scenes in the movie happened to be filmed right in our own backyard here in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar, Percy Jackson is a young demigod who sets out on a thrilling adventure to save the world from ultimate destruction. Along the way he makes new friends and faces off against powerful enemies, all while trying to keep his identity a secret. As it turns out, some of those enemies happen to be immortal creatures known as casino gods, and it’s one of these scenes that was shot near Bishkek.</p>
<p>Although much of the movie was filmed in locations around Europe, director Chris Columbus was keen on finding a spot that could replicate Mount Olympus. After doing some research he came across a website for Central Asia Photo Treks, which features some amazing photos of Kyrgyzstan. In an interview with Deadline he said: “After looking through their website and seeing all of the amazing locations they had photographed in Kyrgyzstan I knew we had found our Mount Olympus”.</p>
<p>So what can Kyrgyzstan expect now that its name is being mentioned alongside Hollywood blockbusters? Well according to industry experts, it could mean big things for tourism. In fact, just a few weeks ago an article in The Diplomat listed Kyrgyzstan as one of 5 up-and-coming tourist destinations for 2016. With attractions like our pristine lakes and soaring mountains, it’s no wonder filmmakers are starting to take notice.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for an adventure off the beaten path, or just want to check out some of the places where your favorite movies were filmed, Kyrgyzstan is definitely worth a visit.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Movie-Shot-In-Kyrgyzstan-The-Casino-Scene-In-Percy-Jackson-Was-Filmed-Here"><a href="#Another-Movie-Shot-In-Kyrgyzstan-The-Casino-Scene-In-Percy-Jackson-Was-Filmed-Here" class="headerlink" title="Another Movie Shot In Kyrgyzstan? The Casino Scene In Percy Jackson Was Filmed Here!"></a>Another Movie Shot In Kyrgyzstan? The Casino Scene In Percy Jackson Was Filmed Here!</h1><p>Kyrgyzstan is quickly becoming a popular destination for movie producers. The latest film shot in the small Central Asian country is “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters”. Scenes from the casino in the movie were filmed at the gambling hall inside of Hyatt Regency Bishkek.</p>
<p>The casino scene was shot over two days and was directed by Thor Freudenthal. In addition to Percy Jackson, he has also directed Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Hotel for Dogs. The cast and crew of the film were very impressed with Kyrgyzstan and its crews.</p>
<p>Some locals were used as extras in the casino scene and they were excited to be a part of the movie. The casino scene features several gambling games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker. It took about two weeks to complete all the special effects for the scene.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a movie has been shot in Kyrgyzstan. Other films that have been shot here include The Horsemen, The last Samurai, and K withdrawal. Each time a new movie is shot in Kyrgyzstan, it helps to boost tourism in the country.</p>
