Check Out These Tips from the Pros!"></a>Want to Play Better Baseball? Check Out These Tips from the Pros!</h1><p>Baseball is a popular sport enjoyed by many. Though it may seem easy to play, there is more to the game than meets the eye. To improve your game, you need to apply the proper techniques and strategies.</p>
<p>If you want to be a better player, start by practicing your batting stance. You should find a stance that allows you to be comfortable and balanced. When you are ready to hit the ball, take a step forward with your leading foot. Keep your shoulders parallel to home plate and your hands held high.</p>
<p>When batting, aim for the top half of the ball. If you try to hit the bottom of the ball, you will likely miss it entirely. By hitting the top half of the ball, you will increase your chances of getting a hit.</p>
<p>To increase your speed when running bases,practice using only one foot at a time. When you run using both feet, you slow yourself down. By using one foot at a time, you can quickly move up to speed when necessary. This also makes it harder for the opposing team to throw you out.</p>
<p>If you are catching a fly ball, keep your eye on the ball until you have caught it. Many players lose focus when they think they have caught the ball causing them t o drop it or let it get by them. Concentrating on catching the ball will help prevent these things from happening.</p>
<p>When pitching, be sure to use all of your pitches. A variety of pitches will keep the opposing team guessing which one you will use next. This will make them unable to predict what type of pitch is coming their way and make them more likely to strike out.</p>
<p> Practice makes perfect when it comes to baseball skills. The more time you spend practicing,the better player you will become. Whether you practice by yourself or with a team,make sure that you are constantly working on your skills. The more effortyou put in,the better resultsyou will see on the field .</p>
