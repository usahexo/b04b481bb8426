One such feature is the ability to use the Batmobile as a slot machine. To switch on the slot machine, you need to complete a certain task in the game.</p>
<p>The first step is to find and activate four fuse boxes scattered around Gotham City. Once you have found all four, return to the Batcave and approach the large console in the center of the room. Activate it by pressing and holding down both triggers (L2 and R2). A on-screen prompt will then ask you to enter a code.</p>
<p>Use the following code: R2, L1, R1, L2, Up, Left, Down, Right. This will activate the slot machine. Batman Arkham Knight also includes a number of other secret codes that can be used to unlock various rewards.</p>

Finding all of them can be a bit of a challenge, but it is well worth it as you can unlock some very cool rewards. In this guide, we will show you where to find all the Gold Bricks in Batman Arkham Knight.</p>
<p>#The first Gold Brick that you will want to find is the one in the Batcave. It is located near the back of the cave, on the upper level.</p>
<p>#Another Gold Brick that is easy to find is the one in Joker’s Funhouse. It is located right next to the entrance.</p>
<p>#The next Gold Brick that you will want to find is in Ace Chemicals. It is located on the roof near where you fight Bane for the first time.</p>
<p>#One of the more difficult Gold Bricks to find is the one in The Riddler’s Lair. It is located in a secret room that can only be accessed by solving a puzzle. For more information on how to solve this puzzle, check out our guide <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gamefaqs.com/ps4/683064-batman-arkham-knight/cheats">here</a>.</p>
<p>#The final Gold Brick that we will cover in this guide is the one in The Wonder Tower. It is located at the top of the tower, and can only be reached by using the grapnel gun to zip up there.</p>

Note that these will not work all the time, but if you use them often enough, you may just end up winning big!</p>
<p>First, make sure to save your game before playing the slot machine. This is because if you don’t win on your first try, you can reload your game and try again.</p>
<p>Secondly, always bet the maximum amount of coins that you can. This will increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Thirdly, remember which symbols are which. The three different symbols on the slot machine are diamonds, clubs, and hearts. Try to match as many of these symbols as possible in order to win prizes.</p>
<p>Fourthly, keep an eye on the bonus wheel. There is a good chance that you will get a bonus spin if you hit one of the jackpot symbols. Make sure to spin the wheel as soon as you can so that you don’t miss out on any potential bonuses.</p>
<p>Finally, be patient and keep trying. The slot machine isn’t easy to beat, but with a little bit of luck and these tips, you may just be able to come out on top!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-use-the-Slot-Machine-in-Batman-Arkham-Knight"><a href="#How-to-use-the-Slot-Machine-in-Batman-Arkham-Knight" class="headerlink" title="How to use the Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight"></a>How to use the Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight</h1><p>The Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight is a fun diversion that can provide you with helpful rewards if you know how to use it correctly. The Slot Machine is located in the Billiards Room in the Clock Tower.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the Slot Machine is to match three symbols to win a prize. There are six different icons that can appear on the Slot Machine, and each one has a different payout. The payouts are as follows:</p>
<p>Symbol Payout</p>
<p>Heart 10 coins</p>
<p>Club 20 coins</p>
<p>Spade 30 coins</p>
<p>Diamond 50 coins</p>
<p>Money 100 coins</p>
<p>Batarang 500 coins<br>+1,000 for five Batarangs in a row!</p>
<p>  To use the Slot Machine, insert your desired amount of coins into the machine. Once you have inserted your coins, press the start button to begin spinning the reels. The reels will spin for a few seconds and then stop. If you have matched three symbols, you will win the corresponding payout. If you have not matched three symbols, your coins will be returned to you.   The best way to increase your chances of winning at the Slot Machine is to familiarize yourself with all of the different symbols and their payouts. This way, you will know which symbols to aim for when playing the game. Additionally, try to keep an eye on which symbols are being displayed on the machine before making your bet. This will give you some idea about what kind of payout you could potentially win if you match three symbols.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Unlock-the-Slot-Machine-in-Batman-Arkham-Knight"><a href="#How-to-Unlock-the-Slot-Machine-in-Batman-Arkham-Knight" class="headerlink" title="How to Unlock the Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight"></a>How to Unlock the Slot Machine in Batman Arkham Knight</h1><p>There are different methods that can be used to unlock the slot machine in Batman Arkham Knight. The first is to purchase the DLC pack that includes the unlock code. The second is to find the three bandages in the game and then go to the Gotham Casino. The last is to use a cheat code.</p>
<p>The first method is to purchase the DLC pack that includes the unlock code. The DLC pack can be purchased for $4.99 on Steam or for $6.99 on PlayStation Network. Once the DLC has been purchased, the player needs to enter the code “Kryptonite” into the console command line in order to unlock it.</p>
<p>The second method is to find the three bandages in the game and then go to the Gotham Casino. The bandages can be found in different locations depending on which platform the game is being played on. The Xbox One version of the game has a bandage located in Ace Chemicals, one located underneath Solomon Wayne Courthouse, and one located at Founders Island. The PlayStation 4 version of the game has a bandage located at Panessa Studios, one located underneath LadyJustice statue in Gotham City Hall, and one located at Amusement Mile. The PC version of the game does not have any specific locations for finding bandages, but they will generally be located near major landmarks.</p>
<p>Once all three bandages have been found, they need to be taken to Harley Quinn’s office in Joker’s Funhouse. In order to get into Joker’s Funhouse, there are two methods that can be used: either ride Harley Quinn’s bike throughout Gotham City or use her special keycard that she drops after completing level 12 of AR Challenges. After taking all three bandages to Harley Quinn’s office, she will give players access to the Gotham Casino where they can use them to play on the slot machine.</p>
<p>The last method is to use a cheat code. A cheat code for unlocking casino content can be found below:</p>
<p>unlock_content C7aa0</p>
<p>Once this has been entered into the console command line, players will have access to all of Harley Quinn’s office including her desk with Commissioner Gordon tied up inside and also allows them to play onthe slot machine inBatman Arkham Knight once more</p>
