<p> Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was spotted at the tables on Tuesday, and he was seen chatting with dealers and other players. He also seemed to be having some success, as he was seen walking away from the tables with some winnings.</p>
<p>This is good news for the Steelers, who could use a bit of positive momentum heading into the playoffs. The team has had a somewhat inconsistent season, but it will be looking to make a deep run in the postseason.</p>
<p>If Roethlisberger can continue to have success at the blackjack tables, it could provide the team with some extra motivation. And if the Steelers do manage to go on a run in the playoffs, don’t be surprised if Roethlisberger is sporting a big smile – and a few extra dollars – from his time in Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="Steelers-dominate-blackjack-tables-in-Vegas"><a href="#Steelers-dominate-blackjack-tables-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Steelers dominate blackjack tables in Vegas"></a>Steelers dominate blackjack tables in Vegas</h1><p>When in Vegas, the Pittsburgh Steelers love to hit the blackjack tables.</p>
<p>Antonio Brown seems to have a knack for winning big at the blackjack tables. In fact, he’s been known to take on multiple tables at once and leave as a big winner.</p>
<p>In fact, in December 2017, Brown hit a blackjack jackpot worth $10,000. He was playing two different tables at the same time and managed to win nearly $2,000 from each table!</p>
<p>But Brown isn’t the only Steelers player who loves to gamble in Las Vegas. Fellow wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is also a big fan of blackjack. In fact, he even hired a personal blackjack coach to help him improve his game.</p>
<p>So if you’re ever in Vegas and see the Steelers players hitting the blackjack tables, be sure to join them – you might just walk away a winner yourself!</p>
<h1 id="Steelers-show-they’re-the-masters-of-blackjack-in-Vegas"><a href="#Steelers-show-they’re-the-masters-of-blackjack-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Steelers show they’re the masters of blackjack in Vegas"></a>Steelers show they’re the masters of blackjack in Vegas</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers put on a clinic at the blackjack tables this weekend when they travelled to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Led by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, the Steelers managed to win almost $200,000 over the course of their visit.</p>
<p>The team started their gambling spree by taking on the casinos in a series of head-to-head matchups. And they didn’t just win - they absolutely crushed their opponents.</p>
<p>Head coach Mike Tomlin was even seen in one casino grinning from ear-to-ear after his team took down a table full of high rollers.</p>
<p>“My guys were absolutely on fire this weekend,” said Tomlin. “We couldn’t lose.”</p>
<p>The Steelers’ impressive run came to an end on Sunday night, however, when they faced off against the house itself. But even then, they walked away with more than $60,000 in profits.</p>
<p>“We knew we were going to have a good trip when we landed in Vegas,” said Roethlisberger. “And we sure showed everyone what we’re made of.”</p>
<h1 id="Steelers-come-out-on-top-at-blackjack-tables-in-Vegas"><a href="#Steelers-come-out-on-top-at-blackjack-tables-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Steelers come out on top at blackjack tables in Vegas"></a>Steelers come out on top at blackjack tables in Vegas</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers had a great time in Las Vegas last weekend, thanks in part to their Blackjack skills.</p>
<p>Most of the players reported that they won money at the tables, with Joe Haden and Stephon Tuitt leading the way. Haden reportedly walked away with almost $10,000 in winnings, while Tuitt took home around $7,000.</p>
<p>“I was up a little bit and down a little bit, but I made money in the end,” said Le’Veon Bell. “I think I had around six or seven straight wins at one point.”</p>
<p>While the Steelers enjoyed their time playing blackjack, they were also able to enjoy some other aspects of Las Vegas. Ben Roethlisberger went swimming in a shark tank and Antonio Brown went to a nightclub called Hakkasan.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great trip for the Steelers and they are looking forward to returning to Vegas in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Steelers-prove-they-are-the-best-when-playing-blackjack-in-Vegas"><a href="#Steelers-prove-they-are-the-best-when-playing-blackjack-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Steelers prove they are the best when playing blackjack in Vegas"></a>Steelers prove they are the best when playing blackjack in Vegas</h1><p>As the Steelers were in the process of boarding their plane for their trip to Las Vegas, some joking around led to a wager on who the best blackjack player on the team was. Ben Roethlisberger stepped up and said he’d put his $100 pocket change on it, and the rest of the team quickly took him up on the challenge.</p>
<p>Arriving in Vegas, they headed to one of the many casinos on The Strip and found a table with six spots. Big Ben took one of the seats, as did Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, Le’Veon Bell, Jesse James, and Artie Burns.</p>
<p>The dealer gave each player two cards, face up. Brown and Bryant both had an Ace-King combination, while Roethlisberger had an Ace-6. No one else had anything close to as good as those first two players.</p>
<p>The dealer then gave herself two cards, also face up. One was a 2 and the other was a 6. This made the casino owner very happy because now he could take money from all of the players except for Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>Bell was next to act and decided to hit, hoping for something better than his 4 total. The dealer turned over another 4, giving him an 8 total – not great but better than before. James decided to stay with his original 5 total, as did Burns with his 3 total.</p>
<p>At this point, Bryant decided he wanted out of the hand and folded his cards. That left Brown and Roethlisberger in the hand against each other. With no more cards being drawn, it all came down to who would make the better hand.</p>
<p>Brown flipped over his second card – a Queen – which meant that he had two pair (Aces and Queens). This was better than Roethlisberger’s two pair (Aces and 6s), so Antonio Brown was proclaimed the winner of the blackjack hand (and $100 from Big Ben).</p>
<p>It turns out that brown is not just one of the best wide receivers in the NFL – he’s also one of the best blackjack players!</p>
