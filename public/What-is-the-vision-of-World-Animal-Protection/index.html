            <h1 id="What-is-the-vision-of-World-Animal-Protection"><a href="#What-is-the-vision-of-World-Animal-Protection" class="headerlink" title="What is the vision of World Animal Protection?"></a>What is the vision of World Animal Protection?</h1><p>The vision of World Animal Protection is a world where animals are respected and protected. They work towards this goal by inspiring people to change the way they think about animals, influencing decision-makers to make better choices for animals, and working with businesses to improve animal welfare.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which World Animal Protection works to protect animals is by campaigning for laws that improve their welfare. For example, they have campaigned for an end to caged egg production, the ivory trade, and the use of wild animals in circuses. They also work with companies to ensure that their practices do not harm animals, such as by ensuring that slaughterhouses operate humanely.</p>
<p>In addition to their work on behalf of animals, World Animal Protection also provides relief and support to animals who have been affected by disasters or conflict. They have worked in countries such as Syria, Iraq, and Nepal to provide food and shelter to stranded animals, and they have distributed traps and other equipment necessary for humane animal trapping.</p>
<p>Ultimately, World Animal Protection wants to see a world where animals are treated with the respect they deserve. By working towards this goal through campaigns, education, and relief efforts, they help make the world a better place for both people and animals.</p>
<h1 id="What-campaigns-does-World-Animal-Protection-run"><a href="#What-campaigns-does-World-Animal-Protection-run" class="headerlink" title="What campaigns does World Animal Protection run?"></a>What campaigns does World Animal Protection run?</h1><p>World Animal Protection (WAP) is a global animal protection organization. It runs a variety of campaigns designed to protect animals from cruelty and abuse. Some of the most well-known campaigns that WAP runs are its work to stop the use of bears in bile farming, its campaign against ivory trade, and its efforts to end the dog meat trade.</p>
<p>Bears are often kept in tiny cages on bile farms, where their bile is extracted for use in traditional Chinese medicine. WAP has been working to stop this practice for many years. In 2014, it successfully campaigned for a ban on the exporting of bear bile from China. It continues to work to close down all bear bile farms around the world.</p>
<p>The ivory trade is another issue that WAP has been campaigning against for many years. The organization believes that elephants should be allowed to live out their natural lives in the wild, and that they should not be killed for their tusks. In 2016, WAP joined forces with other organizations to launch the #BackTheBan campaign, which called on the UK government to ban all ivory trade in the country. The campaign was successful, and in April 2018, the UK government announced a ban on all ivory trade in the country.</p>
<p>WAP has also been campaigning against the dog meat trade for many years. The organization believes that dogs should not be killed for food, and that they should be treated with compassion and respect. In 2017, WAP launched the Dog Meat-Free Indonesia campaign, which aims to end the dog meat trade in Indonesia. The campaign has been successful in raising awareness about this issue, and it has helped to get some key laws changed in Indonesia.</p>

We have more than 800,000 supporters and a network of more than 3,000 animal welfare groups in over 150 countries.</p>
<p>We have around 200 staff working in our London office, and we have country offices in 11 other countries.</p>
<p>We also have fieldworkers in many other countries who work with local partners to protect animals.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-money-does-World-Animal-Protection-raise-each-year"><a href="#How-much-money-does-World-Animal-Protection-raise-each-year" class="headerlink" title="How much money does World Animal Protection raise each year?"></a>How much money does World Animal Protection raise each year?</h1><p>According to their website, World Animal Protection has raised over $2.5 million in the past year. This money is used to help animals in need all over the world.</p>
<p>The majority of this money comes from individual donations. However, World Animal Protection also raises money through other methods, such as grants and partnerships.</p>
<p>One of the main ways that World Animal Protection helps animals is by working with governments and other organizations to create laws that protect animals. For example, they helped create a law in Vietnam that bans the use of dogs and cats for human consumption. They have also helped pass similar laws in countries such as India, Thailand, and Korea.</p>
<p>World Animal Protection also provides disaster relief to animals who are affected by natural disasters. For instance, they provided aid to animals affected by the earthquakes in Nepal in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>Ultimately, World Animal Protection helps countless animals every year thanks to the generosity of donors like you! Please consider making a donation today to help them continue their valuable work.</p>
